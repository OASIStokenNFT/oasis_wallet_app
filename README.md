# OASIS Wallet
### Decentralized Exchange App

We believe that private property is untouchable and market access is unconditional.

That is why we engineered a crypto exchange that is equally open to all, lives online forever and unconditionally protects your assets.

It is fully peer-to-peer and works without any centrally managed servers. It can't be stopped, blocked or taken down.

Such approach enables the wallet to operate anywhere and remain censorship-resistant. Only the user is in control of the money.

Wallet to wallet token trading is the most secure way to trade ERC20 tokens directly from your Ethereum wallet.

Trading cryptocurrencies doesn't have to mean losing custody. Use UDEX to maintain control of your ERC20 tokens while trading directly from your wallet. Trade when you want, where you want, without a middleman.
